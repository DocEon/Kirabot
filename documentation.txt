KIRABOT main commands:

"Kirahelp" links to this document.

~~~ ROLLING DICE ~~~ :

The standard syntax for rolling dice is XdY, where X is the number of dice you want to roll and Y is the number of sides of dice

	[22:54] Fin: 5d10
	[22:54] KiraBot: Fin,  5d10: [3, 4, 1, 10, 1]  


The SORT prefix will sort your results. e.g. "sort 5d10"

	[22:54] Fin: sort 5d10
	[22:54] KiraBot: Fin,  5d10: [1, 6, 6, 8, 9]  

If you add a difficulty to the end of the roll, Kira will count your successes and output them after the results. e.g. "5d10 diff6"

	[22:54] Fin: 5d10 diff6
	[22:54] KiraBot: Fin, 5d10: [5, 2, 3, 8, 3] (1 success)]

You can use multiple commands at once: e.g. "sort 5d10 diff6"

	[22:54] Fin: sort 5d10 diff6
	[22:54] KiraBot: Fin, 5d10: [3, 5, 5, 7, 10] (2 successes)

If you say "always-sort", Kira will sort your dice by default. Doesn't persist on rebooting the bot yet.

If you say "manual-mode", Kira will never sort your dice and will never count your successes. Ramc has this on by default.

~~~ GENERAL COMMANDS ~~~ :

"Kirabot, <COMMAND>" will have Kira output <COMMAND> directly to the IRC server. You can do a lot of stuff with this. 
It's possible to have Kirabot join channels, change channel modes, give out ops, and kick using this generic command.

	[22:59] Fin: Kirabot, kick #MAGE Fin
	[22:59] You have been kicked out of the channel
	[22:59] KiraBot has kicked Fin (Fin)

"Kirasay <WORDS>" will have Kira say <WORDS> in whatever channel you tell him to say something. TODO: Kirasay #channel <WORDS> to allow for remote control.

~~~ QUOTE DATABASE ~~~

Kirabot has a text file, quotes.txt, where he stores some quotes from Karen's big quote googledoc. He loads this up as a database every time he starts up.

You can access a specific quote by its index using the "Kiraquote" commmand. 

	[23:04] Fin: Kiraquote 6
	[23:04] KiraBot: Quote #6:
	[23:04] KiraBot: [23:09] <@Ramc> (this isn't a dating sim)
	[23:04] KiraBot: [23:09] <Candace> (false)
	[23:04] KiraBot: [23:10] <Candace> (this is actually incredibly like a dating sim)
	[23:04] KiraBot: [23:10] <@Ramc> (candace who is your love interest even)
	[23:04] KiraBot: [23:10] <@Ramc> (jesus?)

If you want a quote but don't know the index, you can use "Kirasearch <STRING>" 

	[23:04] Ramc: BoMage, the dating sim
	[23:04] Ramc: I think there is like one other dating sim joke in there too
	[23:04] Ramc: something about Edward getting the Bad Ending
	[23:05] Fin: Kirasearch dating
	[23:05] KiraBot: Found match(es) in quotes #6, #7.

~~~ OTHER STUFF: ~~~

Kira will op you if you say "wz"

	[22:55] Fin: wz
	[22:55] KiraBot has changed mode: +o Fin

Kira also has a few phrases that he answers with speech. You can find those in the code if you really want to see them.
